# Home Equity Lines of Credit(HELOCs) Probability of Defaults Analysis

## 1- Business Goals Overview
Analyzing the **Probability of Default (PD)** for a financial entity like a **Helco** (Home Equity Line of Credit) involves assessing borrowers' likelihood of failing to meet their debt obligations. The primary goal is to help stakeholders accurately assess and manage **default risks**, ensuring regulatory compliance, maintaining portfolio health, and making informed decisions that balance risk and profitability.
                                                                                    
## 2- Technical Highlights
This project extensively leveraged the powerful capabilities of **Python** to conduct a comprehensive range of tasks including meticulous data cleaning, sophisticated preprocessing techniques, intricate modeling, and creating detailed, insightful visualizations achieved by using **Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** to effectively handle and interpret the dataset. In the realm of predictive modeling, the project went beyond the conventional use of **Logistic regression**, embracing more sophisticated and advanced machine learning algorithms. Specifically, it included the implementation of **Decision Trees and Random Forest models**. These models are known for their ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships in data, and they provide robust, data-driven insights.
